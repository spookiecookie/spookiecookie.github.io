I was so many times confused with polymorphism that I will write it down here. Recently I noticed that there are two terms "static type" of the object and "dynamic type" of the object.

The "static type" of the object is the type of the base class reference. The "dynamic type" of the object is the type of the actual object pointed by the reference at the runtime.

STATIC is at COMPILE TIME
DYNAMIC is at RUN  TIME.
